int func(int N,int *weight,int S)
{
->N means the number of weights left
->weight is an array containing the weights
->S we need to achieve this weight
->Handle termination cases

->option1. Donot keep weight[N-1] in basket
	which means we need to attain 
	S from the next N-1 weights 
	so call func(N-1,weight,S);
->option2. keep weight[N-1] in basket 
  which means we need to attain
  S-weight[N-1] next N-1 weights
  so call func(N-1,weight,S-weight[N-1]);

return the sum of the above solutions
}

main(){
->scan the input
->call the function with 
  appropriate parameters
}
