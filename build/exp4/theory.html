        <h2>Theory</h2>
        <p><h3>Problem 1</h3>
<pre>
	We shall try to calculate the factorial of a number  and then find out the number of digits in it.
        1! = 1
       	2! = 1*2 = 2
	3! = 1*2*3 = 6
        4! = 1*2*3*4 = 24
	.
	.
	.
	10! = 3628800
 	So n! means multiplying all the numbers from 1 to n.
	For the sample Input 52 we can see from the sample output that the factorial of 52 is
	68 digits and this cannot fit in long long data type in C.You may now attempt to
	store the answer in a string and do multiplication operation on strings(by multiplying each digit
	of the string individually). Now let us see how many operations do we need for multiplying 2 
	strings.Consider 11!, 11! = 11*10!, assume we already have 10! stored in a string and 11 stored in a string.
	Now to calculate 11! from 10! we need to multiply each digit of 11 with each digit of 10! i.e it would 
	take No_digits(11) * No_digits(3628800) = 2*7 = 14 operations.We consider only multiplication operations 
	(we also have to consider addition operations for each of the biproducts and carries).

	Similarly 53! would take 2*68=136 operations from 52!.
	52! would take 2*67 = 134 operations from 51! 
	51! would take 2*65 = 130 operations from 50!.
	 
        We can see that there would be a operations required for calculating  53! (No_operations = 136+134+130+...+1)
	Also in 1000000! the number of digits is 5565709, so we would require large amount of storage and both these 
	difficulties make calculation of  N! hard.


	Is there any way to find the number of digits without actually calculating N!? Let us consider a simple problem
	of finding the number of digits in a number N.Consider N = 12 , we can also write this as 0.12*10^2 which is a 2 
	digit number . Consider N=125 , which can be written as 0.125 *10^3 which is a 3 digit number. Evidently calcula-
	-ting the exponent of 10 in the scientific notaion and gives the number of digits.For any N ,N=x*10^exp 
        => log10(N) = log10(x) + exp. for n=95 log10(95) = log10(0.95)+exp since 95 = 0.95 *10^2. 
	N = x*10^exp , x<1 
	Taking step on both sides . 
	=> step(log10(N)) = step(log10(x)+exp) 
	=> step(log10(N)) = exp-1 
	=> exp = step(log10(N))+1
	=> No_digits(N) = step(log10(N))+1
	
	Applying the above formula to calculate the number of digits of N! gives
	No_digits(N!) = step(log10(N!) ) +1
	=> No_digits(N!) = step(log10(N*(N-1)*(N-2)*(N-3)...*2*1)) + 1
	=> No_digits(N!) = step(log10(N) + log10(N-1) + log10(N-2) + ...+log10(2) + log10(1) ) +1

	log10(N) can be easily calculated by the log10 function in math.h.

<p><h3>Problem 2</h3>
<pre>
	Let us observe the zeroes in the factorial of a few numbers.
	
	4!=24		(0 zeroes)
	5!=120		(1 zeroes)
	6!=720		(1 zeroes)
	7!=5040		(1 zeroes)
	8!=40320	(1 zeroes)
	9!=362880	(1 zeroes)
	10!=3628800	(2 zeroes)
	11!-14!		(2 zeroes)
	15!		(3 zeroes)
	We can observe that for every multiple of 5, we have a zero being added to the product. This is due to the
	multiplication of 5 with an even number in the product. So, our problem simplifies to counting the number of 5's
	in the factors of the number to be calculated.
	
	Let us formalize the proof.
	Let p be a prime number.

	n!=1×2×…×(n−1)×n
	We see that any integer m such that 0 < m ≤ n which is divisible by p^j and not p^(j+1) must be counted exactly j
	times.
	That is: once in ⌊n/p⌋, once in ⌊n/(p^2)⌋, …, once in ⌊n(p^j)⌋.
	And that is all the occurrences of p as a factor of n!.
	Thus:
	μ(No. of occurences of p)=⌊n/p⌋+⌊n/(p^2)⌋+⋯+⌊n/(p^j)⌋
	
Ex:No. of zeroes in 25!(No of occurences of 5 in 25!)=(⌊25/5⌋+⌊25/(5^2)⌋)=5+1=6
